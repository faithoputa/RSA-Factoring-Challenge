RSA is a widely used cryptographic algorithm that is commonly used for secure data transmission over the internet. It is based on the mathematical concept of prime factorization and is named after the mathematicians Ron Rivest, Shamir Adleman, and Leonard Adleman who developed it in the 1970s.

RSA uses two large prime numbers and a small integer, called n, to generate a public and a private key. The public key is used to encrypt messages, which anyone can do, while the private key is used to decrypt those messages. This allows for secure communication between two parties without the need to exchange secret keys beforehand.

HTTPS, on the other hand, is a secure version of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) that uses SSL or TLS encryption to secure data transmission. These protocols are widely used for secure comminication over the internet.

So in simple words, RSA is a public key cryptosystem and HTTPS uses RSA to provide for secure data. Welcome to Alx-RSA Challange!
